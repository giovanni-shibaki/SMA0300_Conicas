# SMA0300 - Conic Section Rotation and Translation Algorithm in C# Winforms
This project is part of SMA0300 Analytical Geometry course in USP Sao Carlos. Given a general conic section equation, this software can process it by applying rotation and translation techniques (as presented by Prof Farid's class notes) and, thus, returning a simplified equation.
