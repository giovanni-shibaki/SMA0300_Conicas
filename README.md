# SMA0300 - Conic Section Rotation and Translation Algorithm in C# Winforms
This project is part of SMA0300 Analytical Geometry course in USP Sao Carlos. Given a general conic section equation, this software can process it by applying rotation and translation techniques (as presented by Prof Farid's class notes) and, thus, returning a simplified equation. 

In order to execute matrix operations, we used MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra library in a Visual Studio application. 

## User Interface Images
### Main Menu
 In this window the user can enter all the coeficients of a given general conic section equation. By clicking the "Calcular" button, the mathematical algorithm will initiate.

### Additional Information about the conic section

This interface offers additional information about the conic section expressed in the given equation. For every type of conic section, a certain set of details will be shown on the screen (For exemple, in case of an Elipse, the focus and its excentricity will be shown).
